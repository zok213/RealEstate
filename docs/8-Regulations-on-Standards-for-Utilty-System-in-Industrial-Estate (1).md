Q  =  The maximum Stormwater Runoff Rate in a drainage conduit or ditch as the calculation point, in cubic meters per second; 

C  =  The runoff coefficient, which is a fixed value, without any measurement unit, depending on the profile of such area; 

I  =  The average rainfall intensity in millimeters per hour; 

A  =  The areas in square kilometers which are destined for water discharge. 

Clause 17  The storm drainage system shall be open ditches or closed conduits, with or without manhole, as suitable for the industrial estate areas.
